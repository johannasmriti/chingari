          <h2>The Tragedy</h2>
          <p>In their struggle to safeguard their livelihoods, some of the workers realised early on that the Bhopal gas tragedy had not only compromised their ability to earn a decent living but had also robbed them of their health and well-being.  </p>
          <p>Neither the government nor Union Carbide took responsibility for ensuring that the gas victims were provided adequate employment, or that their ailments would be cured, or that land and water polluted by the chemical wastes from the factory would be rid of their poisons.</p>
          <p>The workers took their struggle against the company to all corners of the country and beyond its shores to the world. </p>

          <h2>A Continuing Disaster:</h2>
          <p>Children born to victims of the gas disaster still continue to pay for the negligence of Union Carbide/Dow Chemicals. They are often born with congenital disabilities like cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, hearing impairedness, down syndrome etc </p>
          <p>The contamination of ground water sources by chemicals leaking from the abandoned factory has only exacerbated the problem</p>
          <p>These children have special needs, in terms of long-term medical care and rehabilitation within their communities. However, nothing was being done for them or their families </p>
